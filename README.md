Ticket Tracker Application is a web-based application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tickets. The application is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies.

The front-end of the application is responsible for displaying the user interface and collecting user input. It is implemented using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface consists of multiple pages such as the Home Screen, Edit page, and Create Ticket page. The Home Screen displays a list of all the tickets that have been created, along with their status, priority, and other relevant details. The user can perform various actions on the tickets such as creating a new ticket, editing an existing ticket, deleting a ticket, or viewing the details of a ticket. The Edit page allows users to modify the details of an existing ticket. The user can update the ticket's status, priority, description, and other relevant information. The Create Ticket page allows users to create a new ticket by providing details such as the ticket's title, description, priority, and status.

The back-end of the application is responsible for processing user requests, storing and retrieving ticket data, and returning appropriate responses to the front-end. It is implemented using technologies such as Java and MySQL. The back-end provides various API endpoints that can be called by the front-end to perform CRUDS (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search) operations on the tickets. For example, when a user creates a new ticket on the front-end, the front-end sends a POST request to the back-end API endpoint, which then stores the new ticket information in the MySQL database. Similarly, when a user edits an existing ticket, the front-end sends a PUT request to the back-end API endpoint, which updates the ticket information in the database.

Overall, the Ticket Tracker Application is a full-stack web application that utilizes a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to provide CRUDS functionality for ticket tracking.
